A wishlist for a window manager (v marks what mcwm fulfills
completely):

v Small.

v Few external dependencies, both for running and building.

v Fast.

v Minimal decoration.

v Sloppy focus.

v Vertical and maximum maximizing.

v Don't move windows off of physical screen. Configurable?

v Window placement on virtual screens should be remembered even if wm
  killed and restarted.

v Quickly move windows to corners.

v Key bindings for all window functions.

- Changing focus from keyboard which rememebers last focused window.
  Keep on the same physical screen. 

- Focus change from keyboard should restore stacking order after focus
  switch.

- Configurable key bindings.

- Know about physical screens dynamically (RandR).

- Key binding to change focus to another physical screen.

- Virtual screens. Separate sets for each physical screen.

  A window should be able to occupy one, several or all virtual
  screens.

- Snap to border and screen edge, which favours the edge.

- Mouse buttons on root window should start some configurable
  programs.

- Feedback window for size when resizing.
