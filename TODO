* IconicState

  Currently we set IconicState only on windows we hide and not when we
  unmap them to switch to another desktop. ICCCM and EWMH says we
  should set IconicState in both situations.

  We should also set _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN when hiding windows.

  hidden.c should list windows with _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN and,
  optionally, all with IconicState.

* When unhiding a window we want it to re-appear in the same position.
  How?

  Setting XCB_ICCCM_SIZE_HINT_US_POSITION before hiding would probably
  work without adding more code, but does ICCCM allow that?

  PPosition?

* Feature: Handle several screens (DISPLAY=0.x) in classical X.

  This means we will have several root windows.

  setup = xcb_get_setup(conn);
  screens = xcb_setup_roots_length(setup);

  returns the number of screens available.

  We can walk over them with xcb_setup_roots_iterator(setup).

* Feature: Xinerama support. Needed when XRANDR above 1.1 not
  supported, for instance with Nvidia cards in Twinview configuration.

* Bug: Ignore other modifiers, such as NumLock and CapsLock.

  We can use something like this to find the modifier mask for
  NumLock:

  xcb_keycode_t *num_lock;
  num_lock = xcb_key_symbols_get_keycode(symbols, XK_Num_Lock);

  and get an array of keycodes finished by XCB_NO_SYMBOL.

  then compare the keycodes in the array with the keycodes all the
  modifier masks give. See getmodkeys().

* Extended Window Manager Hints (EWMH)

  - Use the new xcb-ewmh for the EWMH hints.

  I suggest listing least these in _NET_SUPPORTED (* marks
  implemented):

     _NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS, _NET_WM_DESKTOP*, _NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP,
     _NET_WM_STATE, _NET_WM_STATE_STICKY,
     _NET_WM_STATE_MAXIMIZED_VERT, _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN,
     _NET_WM_STATE_FULLSCREEN, _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW

  _NET_NUMBER_OF_DESKTOPS can be set to the constant WORKSPACES.

  _NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP is just curws. Set the hint when starting and
  when changing workspaces.

  We *may* want to support a message to the root window that *sets*
  _NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP and then switch to it.

  We might want to support _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DESKTOP as well.

* Bug: We grab MODKEY all the time! We can grab it only when we start
  tabbing instead and release it when tabbing is complete.

* Key to move to previous and next workspace. David Jacobs has a patch
  for mod4+shift + I/O.

  https://gist.github.com/1478365

* Key to move windows to other workspaces, perhaps mod4+Shift + 0..9
  and mod4+shift + I/O.

* Full-screen windows that are resized from client requests should be
  kept full-screen.

* When moving windows between monitors, try to place the window on
  roughly the same place on a new monitor, if possible.

* When a window tries to map itself outside the monitors always map it
  on the monitor closest to the coordinates it asked for instead of
  always mapping on the first monitor in the list.

* Feature: We need to continue dragging for move and resize until
  *both* MODKEY and mouse button has been released. Will be much nicer
  with trackball.

* Move to first window (or middle of monitor) on another monitor with
  MODKEY + . and , instead of moving windows to new monitor. Shifted
  these keys will move window to new monitor?

* Handle new modes on physical outputs. What do we have to do?

* A separate workspace list for every monitor.

* Allow hexadecimal colour values on command line.

* Grab specific keys 

  Current code grabs modifier keys and any other keypress. We need to
  specifically grab the keycodes we need. xbindkeys and possibly other
  programs don't work.

  Partially done. Now grabs all our keys unshifted as well as shifted.

* Feedback window
  
  We may need to tell the user the new geometry somehow. Is this what
  I want?

  The feedback window can also show what workspace we just changed to.

  Can we cooperate with a stand-alone program? Write our status to a
  root hint or named pipe than can be picked up by another program?

* Virtual screens/workspaces

  Partially done. Still needed:

  - A window might be on one, *several* or all virtual screens. 

    We already have a way of fixing a window on all screens
    (MODKEY-f), but we need a way of saying "stick on this workspace".
    Perhaps something like MODKEY-a <n>, where <n> is 1--9 for virtual
    screens. Better ways? Note that this seems to be mildly
    incompatible with the EWMH _NET_WM_DESKTOP hint we're currently
    using: We will only be able to save one of the desktops used.

* Menu

  We might need a menu for hidden windows. Since I'm probably
  implementing menu windows anyway, perhaps I should add a menu with
  basic window functions, like 9wm and twm. This way, one might use
  the window manager without keyboard, if necessary. Not much work if
  I have to do the menu anyway... But also chords?

  On the other hand, see hidden.c and forthcoming external menu
  program.

* Chords

  Maybe have mouse button chords to do move and resize? Configurable
  if on or off?

  Idea from Christian Neukirchen.

* Snap to border and screen edge, which favours the edge.

* Gaps on borders for docks, status windows et cetera.

  Keep space reserved for Conky, dzen2 et cetera.
  
  Also respect EWMH hints _NET_WM_TYPE_DOCK and _NET_WM_TYPE_DESKTOP.

* Flag to disable that mcwm won't allow windows to move off the
  screen?

* Use xcb-event's event handlers?

* Configurable keys.

* Configuration file.

* Handle Urgency hint

  Some windows might need attention and marks this with an urgency
  hint (for instance, urxvt can generate such a hint when receiving
  the BEL character). Do we want to handle it? How do we tell the
  user? Can this be done with some stand-alone program instead?

* Code cleaning

  - Obivous cleanup: The event switch is way too big.

  - The states are known everywhere. A tight state machine would be
    nicer.

  - Dispatch table with function pointers for key bindings instead of
    keysym->enum->case?

  - Use bitfields instead of extra lists for workspaces?

* Resize behaviour

  Better resize behaviour. We want not to accidentally change the
  vertical size when changing horizontal size and vice versa.
